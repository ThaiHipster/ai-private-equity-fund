# Claude Code Guidelines by Robert Alward (Edited From Sabrina Romanov)

## Implementation Best Practices

### 0 — Purpose  

These rules ensure maintainability, safety, and developer velocity. 
**MUST** rules are enforced by CI; **SHOULD** rules are strongly recommended.

---

### 1 — Before Coding

- **BP-1 (MUST)** Ask the user clarifying questions.
- **BP-2 (SHOULD)** Draft and confirm an approach for complex work.  
- **BP-3 (SHOULD)** If ≥ 2 approaches exist, list clear pros and cons.
- NOTE - Add New - Utilizing Existing objects, Page object models
- NOTE (A) - If Greenfield project sometimes documenting the project - Starting and updating the diagram file


---

### 2 — While Coding

- NOTE (A) **C-1 (MUST)** Follow TDD: scaffold stub -> write failing test -> implement. (NOTE (A) - Argue against TDD, we have metrics for test coverage. Generate tests to meet the 80% passing coverage on new code - SonarQube)
- **C-2 (MUST)** Name functions with existing domain vocabulary for consistency.  NOTE (A) - Legacy code has naming conventions that does not follow C# naming conventions, don't extend a bad pattern, default to use the language standards, draw context from the codebase and solution.
- **C-3 (SHOULD NOT)** Introduce classes when small testable functions suffice.  
- **C-4 (SHOULD)** Prefer simple, composable, testable functions.
- **(IMPACTED) C-5 (MUST)** Prefer branded `type`s for Ids (NOTE (J,A) - Review this for Relevancy for EverDriven, Relevant for the frontend)
  ```ts
  type UserId = Brand<string, 'UserId'>   // ✅ Good
  type UserId = string                    // ❌ Bad
  ```  
- **(IMPACTED) C-6 (MUST)** Use `import type { … }` for type-only imports.
- **(QA - Joe - Comment the explanation of what happens in a function at the top, as well as inline documentation) 
- C-7 (SHOULD NOT)** Add comments except for critical caveats; rely on self‑explanatory code.
- **(Dont care) C-8 (SHOULD)** Default to `type`; use `interface` only when more readable or interface merging is required. 
- **C-9 (SHOULD NOT)** Extract a new function unless it will be reused elsewhere, is the only way to unit-test otherwise untestable logic, or drastically improves readability of an opaque block.

- ADD EXPLANATION For the team - Why this is needed and when to remove it "Ai has been doing this a lot"
- NOTE - Working with a broad document, working with a broad set of languages.
- NOTE - Add a guide which pushes some code language specific guidance to the end of the file

---

### 3 — Testing

- **T-1 (MUST)** For a simple function, colocate unit tests in `*.spec.ts` in same directory as source file. 
(NOTE (A) - For the backend, we use XUnit in NSubstitute for the mocking framework for testing, Most common are NUnit and moq)
(NOTE (A) - The orginial guidance for the test is for the frontend)
- **T-2 (MUST)** For any API change, add/extend integration tests in `packages/api/test/*.spec.ts`.
(NOTE (A) - The orginial guidance for the test is for the frontend)

- **T-3 (MUST)** ALWAYS separate pure-logic unit tests from DB-touching integration tests.
- **T-4 (SHOULD)** Prefer integration tests over heavy mocking.
- **T-5 (SHOULD)** Unit-test complex algorithms thoroughly.
- **T-6 (SHOULD)** Test the entire structure in one assertion if possible
  ```ts
  expect(result).toBe([value]) // Good

  expect(result).toHaveLength(1); // Bad
  expect(result[0]).toBe(value); // Bad
  ```

- **(NEW) T-7 (SHOULD)** Split tests by page and user
NOTE (A) - Tests that verify the core logic of the application. E.g., tests to test the driver service, not as much the driver API. Don't really need tests for certain things. Specify where it is building
NOTE (A) - you want the system to ask if it is a good test to write

NOTE: Each file is page, split by page and by user, different testing by user and by page
NOTE: Testing won't necessarily be the same for each team and product. The language and test setup will vary
NOTE: The code in QA is tests for Software
NOTE: The unit tests are different from QA tests

---

### 4 — Database (NOTE (J) - REMOVE COMPLETELY FOR QA)
POSTGRES AND MICROSOFT SQL AND COSMOS DB

- **D-1 (MUST)** Type DB helpers as `KyselyDatabase | Transaction<Database>`, so it works for both transactions and DB instances.  
- **D-2 (SHOULD)** Override incorrect generated types in `packages/shared/src/db-types.override.ts`. e.g. autogenerated types show incorrect BigInt value – so we override to `string` manually.

(NOTE (A) - Default, Plain english to query. Would use it for Cosmos DB)

---

### 5 — Code Organization

- **O-1 (MUST)** Place code in `packages/shared` only if used by ≥ 2 packages.
NOTE: VARY BY PRODUCT
NOTE: Look at Playwright and see the organization
NOTE: Data setup different by environment
Page Object Model
Tests Folder
Some Unit tests for the Tests
Utils - Shared utilities, copy and paste when you create a new project with Playwright
- 3,4 Playwrights
- 1 Mobile

---

### 6 — Tooling Gates

- **G-1 (MUST)** `prettier --check` passes.  
- **G-2 (MUST)** `turbo typecheck lint` passes.
NOTE: Some type of Playwright extension, If you're using tests in a non-standard way. Always have an assert etc. - Action - Look that up, Playwright linter
NOTE (A) - No linter for .NET, remove the linter for the backend guidance

---

### 7 - Git

- **GH-1 (MUST**) Use Conventional Commits format when writing commit messages: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0
- **GH-2 (SHOULD NOT**) Refer to Claude or Anthropic in commit messages.
NOTE (A) - Gitignore and check templtate

---

## Writing Functions Best Practices

When evaluating whether a function you implemented is good or not, use this checklist:

1. Can you read the function and HONESTLY easily follow what it's doing? If yes, then stop here.
2. Does the function have very high cyclomatic complexity? (number of independent paths, or, in a lot of cases, number of nesting if if-else as a proxy). If it does, then it's probably sketchy.
3. Are there any common data structures and algorithms that would make this function much easier to follow and more robust? Parsers, trees, stacks / queues, etc.
4. Are there any unused parameters in the function?
5. Are there any unnecessary type casts that can be moved to function arguments?
6. Is the function easily testable without mocking core features (e.g. sql queries, redis, etc.)? If not, can this function be tested as part of an integration test?
7. Does it have any hidden untested dependencies or any values that can be factored out into the arguments instead? Only care about non-trivial dependencies that can actually change or affect the function.
8. Brainstorm 3 better function names and see if the current name is the best, consistent with rest of codebase.

FUN NOTE - AI sucks at naming

IMPORTANT: you SHOULD NOT refactor out a separate function unless there is a compelling need, such as:
  - the refactored function is used in more than one place
  - the refactored function is easily unit testable while the original function is not AND you can't test it any other way
  - the original function is extremely hard to follow and you resort to putting comments everywhere just to explain it

## Writing Tests Best Practices (NOTE (A) - Frontend focused, update to be backend relevant)

Action - Grab examples from Alissa

When evaluating whether a test you've implemented is good or not, use this checklist:

1. SHOULD parameterize inputs; never embed unexplained literals such as 42 or "foo" directly in the test.
2. SHOULD NOT add a test unless it can fail for a real defect. Trivial asserts (e.g., expect(2).toBe(2)) are forbidden.
3. SHOULD ensure the test description states exactly what the final expect verifies. If the wording and assert don’t align, rename or rewrite.
4. SHOULD compare results to independent, pre-computed expectations or to properties of the domain, never to the function’s output re-used as the oracle.
5. SHOULD follow the same lint, type-safety, and style rules as prod code (prettier, ESLint, strict types).
6. (REVIEW THIS) SHOULD express invariants or axioms (e.g., commutativity, idempotence, round-trip) rather than single hard-coded cases whenever practical. Use `fast-check` library e.g.
```
import fc from 'fast-check';
import { describe, expect, test } from 'vitest';
import { getCharacterCount } from './string';

describe('properties', () => {
  test('concatenation functoriality', () => {
    fc.assert(
      fc.property(
        fc.string(),
        fc.string(),
        (a, b) =>
          getCharacterCount(a + b) ===
          getCharacterCount(a) + getCharacterCount(b)
      )
    );
  });
});
```

7. Unit tests for a function should be grouped under `describe(functionName, () => ...`.
8. Use `expect.any(...)` when testing for parameters that can be anything (e.g. variable ids).
9. ALWAYS use strong assertions over weaker ones e.g. `expect(x).toEqual(1)` instead of `expect(x).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(1)`.
10. SHOULD test edge cases, realistic input, unexpected input, and value boundaries.
11. SHOULD NOT test conditions that are caught by the type checker.

## Code Organization (NOTE (J) - CHANGE DEPENDING ON PROJECT FROM THE README)

- `packages/api` - Fastify API server
  - `packages/api/src/publisher/*.ts` - Specific implementations of publishing to social media platforms
- `packages/web` - Next.js 15 app with App Router
- `packages/shared` - Shared types and utilities
  - `packages/shared/social.ts` - Character size and media validations for social media platforms
- `packages/api-schema` - API contract schemas using TypeBox

- README.md - Project specific guidance, Have the Reame updated along the way

## Remember Shortcuts

Remember the following shortcuts which the user may invoke at any time.

### QNEW

When I type "qnew", this means:

```
Understand all BEST PRACTICES listed in CLAUDE.md.
Your code SHOULD ALWAYS follow these best practices.
```

### QPLAN
When I type "qplan", this means:
```
Analyze similar parts of the codebase and determine whether your plan:
- is consistent with rest of codebase
- introduces minimal changes
- reuses existing code
```

## QCODE

When I type "qcode", this means:

```
Implement your plan and make sure your new tests pass.
Always run tests to make sure you didn't break anything else.
Always run `prettier` on the newly created files to ensure standard formatting.
Always run `turbo typecheck lint` to make sure type checking and linting passes.
```

### QCHECK

When I type "qcheck", this means:

```
You are a SKEPTICAL senior software engineer.
Perform this analysis for every MAJOR code change you introduced (skip minor changes):

1. CLAUDE.md checklist Writing Functions Best Practices.
2. CLAUDE.md checklist Writing Tests Best Practices.
3. CLAUDE.md checklist Implementation Best Practices.
```

### QCHECKF

When I type "qcheckf", this means:

```
You are a SKEPTICAL senior software engineer.
Perform this analysis for every MAJOR function you added or edited (skip minor changes):

1. CLAUDE.md checklist Writing Functions Best Practices.
```

### QCHECKT

When I type "qcheckt", this means:

```
You are a SKEPTICAL senior software engineer.
Perform this analysis for every MAJOR test you added or edited (skip minor changes):

1. CLAUDE.md checklist Writing Tests Best Practices.
```

### QUX

When I type "qux", this means:

```
Imagine you are a human UX tester of the feature you implemented. 
Output a comprehensive list of scenarios you would test, sorted by highest priority.
```

### QBACKENDTESTs (NOTE (A) - make backend relevant test guidance and integration tests)

Based on a series of changes what to test.

```
Imagine you are a human UX tester of the feature you implemented. 
Output a comprehensive list of scenarios you would test, sorted by highest priority.
```

### QGIT

When I type "qgit", this means:

```
Add all changes to staging, create a commit, and push to remote.

Follow this checklist for writing your commit message:
- SHOULD use Conventional Commits format: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0
- SHOULD NOT refer to Claude or Anthropic in the commit message.
- SHOULD structure commit message as follows:
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
[optional body]
[optional footer(s)]
- commit SHOULD contain the following structural elements to communicate intent: 
fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the Angular convention) recommends build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, and others.
footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided and follow a convention similar to git trailer format.
```
